# Theseus-Project-V1
A realy old wallhack project (2016)

Based on a old polymorphic code


This project uses a memory wrapper "procmem", created by fleep in 2013. Works the same way as:
```
ReadProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, lpBuffer, nSize, *lpNumberOfBytesRead);

WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, lpBuffer, nSize, *lpNumberOfBytesWritten);
```
